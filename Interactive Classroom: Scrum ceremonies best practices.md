## 10 Best practices for sprint planning

### **10 Best Practices for a Highly Accurate and Efficient Sprint Planning Meeting**  

1. **Prepare and refine GitHub issues in advance**  
   - Ensure every issue has a clear description, acceptance criteria, and is properly scoped before the meeting.  
   - PMs and tech leads should pre-review tickets to remove ambiguity.  

2. **Base estimates on real past data**  
   - Use previous sprints to compare estimated vs. actual dev days and adjust accordingly.  
   - Keep track of over/underestimations to refine accuracy over time.  

3. **Break down work into small, manageable tasks**  
   - Avoid vague or large issues—split them into smaller, well-defined tasks with a clear "definition of done."  
   - If something is too uncertain, create a research/spike task first.  

4. **Account for non-development work**  
   - Include time for reviews, testing, bug fixes, deployments, and meetings in estimates.  
   - Identify dependencies early to prevent blockers.  

5. **Ensure everyone commits to their estimates**  
   - Developers should actively participate in estimating dev days to ensure ownership.  
   - Discuss and adjust estimates collaboratively rather than having a single person dictate them.  

6. **Use a structured format: priorities first**  
   - Start with the highest-priority issues and critical tasks.  
   - Avoid wasting time on low-priority items that might not even make it into the sprint.  

7. **Balance workload realistically**  
   - Ensure no one is overloaded; leave buffer time for unexpected issues.  
   - Consider developer availability (vacations, meetings, parallel projects).  

8. **Clarify dependencies upfront**  
   - Identify external blockers (e.g., waiting on data access, APIs, third-party inputs).  
   - Assign owners to follow up on dependencies before they become problems.  

9. **Keep the meeting time-boxed and focused**  
   - Avoid unnecessary discussions—defer deep technical discussions to breakout sessions.  
   - Use a facilitator (usually the PM) to keep things moving.  

10. **End with a clear sprint commitment**  
   - Summarize the final sprint scope and expectations.  
   - Confirm that the team is confident in the plan and no major uncertainties remain.

## **3. Daily Standup Real-World Problem Solving (10 min)**  
🎯 *Goal:* Make standups more valuable and engaging.  

🔹 **Activity: The Standup Critique**  
- Split into small groups (or discuss together).  
- Each group picks a **real** standup they’ve experienced and analyzes:  
  - What made it **useful**?  
  - What made it **ineffective**?  
  - One **change** that would have improved it.  

🔹 **Debrief Discussion:**  
- How do you handle **blockers in GitHub** to avoid repeating “I’m still stuck on X”?  
- What’s the best way to track **unplanned work** without derailing the sprint?  

🔹 **Actionable Insight:**  
- Have everyone write down *one tweak* they will try in their next standup.

### **Top 10 Best Practices for Effective Daily Standups**  

1. **Keep it short (max 15 minutes)**  
   - Stay focused on key updates; avoid long discussions.  
   - If deeper discussions are needed, schedule a follow-up after standup.  

2. **Use a structured format**  
   - Stick to: **What was done? What’s next? Any blockers?**  
   - Keep it action-oriented, not a status report.  

3. **Make blockers the priority**  
   - If someone is stuck, immediately assign a follow-up or solution.  
   - Encourage proactive problem-solving instead of just reporting issues.  

4. **Refer to GitHub boards for visibility**  
   - Update issues before the standup so the board reflects actual progress.  
   - Move tasks through the board as part of the conversation.  

5. **Don’t just repeat what’s in GitHub—add value**  
   - Instead of saying, *"I'm working on X,"* share insights like:  
     *"I'm working on X, but I ran into a dependency on Y—I'll sync with John after this."*  

6. **Time-box each person’s update**  
   - If someone starts going deep into details, politely remind them to take it offline.  

7. **Encourage engagement, not just reporting**  
   - Ask: *"Do you need help with that?"* or *"What’s slowing this down?"*  
   - Foster a culture where team members help unblock each other.  

8. **Rotate facilitation (optional)**  
   - Having different team members lead the standup keeps it fresh and engaging.  

9. **Be mindful of remote/hybrid setups**  
   - Ensure remote participants are actively included, not just listening.  
   - Use video or async updates when needed.  

10. **End with clarity and action**  
   - Confirm next steps for any blockers.  
   - Leave with a sense of alignment, not just a list of updates.

## **4. Sprint Review & Stakeholder Engagement (10 min)**  
🎯 *Goal:* Improve stakeholder involvement and feedback loops.  

🔹 **Activity: Reverse Brainstorming**  
- **Question:** *“If we wanted to make sprint reviews completely useless, what would we do?”*  
- Generate bad ideas (e.g., “Only engineers talk,” “Show slides instead of a demo”).  
- Flip them into **positive best practices** (e.g., “Ensure stakeholders interact with the feature live”).  

🔹 **Debrief Discussion:**  
- How do you get **stakeholders actively involved** instead of just listening?  
- What’s a **great sprint review moment** you’ve experienced?  

### Top 10 best practices for sprint reviews

1. **Focus on working software, not slides**  
   - Show live demos or working prototypes.  
   - Avoid lengthy PowerPoint presentations.  

2. **Involve stakeholders actively, not just as spectators**  
   - Ask stakeholders for their input during the demo.  
   - Encourage them to interact with the product in real-time.  

3. **Keep it interactive with live demos and discussions**  
   - Allow team members to walk through the demo and explain their work.  
   - Have an open discussion on how features will be used or improved.  

4. **Showcase real user value, not just completed tasks**  
   - Focus on how the work contributes to the user's experience or business outcomes.

5. **Tie updates to sprint goals and business impact**  
   - Relate each demo to the sprint goals to show alignment.  
   - Highlight how the work supports long-term business objectives.  

6. **Encourage open feedback and questions**  
   - Create an open environment where stakeholders can ask questions.  
   - Make it clear that feedback is valuable and encourages continuous improvement.  

7. **Prepare in advance to ensure a smooth demo**  
   - Test the demo ahead of time to avoid technical glitches.  
   - Ensure all required resources (e.g., accounts, devices) are ready.  

8. **Address challenges faced during the sprint**  
   - Highlight any roadblocks encountered and how they were addressed.  
   - Share learnings and adjustments made throughout the sprint.  

9. **Keep it time-boxed and structured**  
   - Stick to a clear agenda and avoid veering off-topic.  
   - Ensure that each team member has equal time to present their work.  

10. **Capture action items for follow-ups and improvements**  
   - Note down feedback and action points that need attention in the next sprint.  
   - Assign owners to follow up on any unresolved issues or suggestions.

## **5. Retrospective Game: What’s One Thing We’ll Change? (10 min)**  
🎯 *Goal:* Ensure retrospectives drive real change.  

🔹 **Activity: "Speed Retrospective"**  
- Everyone writes down *one improvement they implemented from a past retro that worked well.*  
- Share in a rapid-fire round.  
- Discuss: *“What’s one thing you wish retros could improve in our team?”*  

🔹 **Action Step:**  
- Vote on **one experiment** to try in the next sprint retro.  

### Top 10 best practices for retros

1. **Create a safe environment for open discussion**  
   - Ensure everyone feels comfortable sharing feedback, both positive and negative.  
   - Foster a culture of respect and psychological safety.  

2. **Focus on actionable items**  
   - Identify concrete actions that can improve processes in the next sprint.  
   - Avoid abstract feedback; make sure action items are specific and achievable.  

3. **Keep it time-boxed**  
   - Stick to the agreed time limit to maintain focus and energy.  
   - Avoid dragging the meeting on with unnecessary discussions.  

4. **Mix up retrospective formats**  
   - Change the format regularly to keep it engaging (e.g., "Start, Stop, Continue," "4Ls," or "Mad, Sad, Glad").  
   - Try different facilitation techniques to keep things fresh.  

5. **Celebrate wins and successes**  
   - Acknowledge the team’s achievements, even small ones, to build morale.  
   - Celebrate positive outcomes before diving into challenges.  

6. **Include everyone’s perspective**  
   - Ensure all team members have an opportunity to speak.  
   - Use techniques like round-robin or silent brainstorming to include quieter voices.  

7. **Identify root causes, not just symptoms**  
   - Focus on finding the underlying causes of issues instead of just addressing surface-level problems.  
   - Use tools like the “5 Whys” to dig deeper into problems.  

8. **Encourage continuous improvement**  
   - Regularly reflect on how the retrospective process itself can improve.  
   - Keep iterating on how retrospectives are run to ensure they remain effective.  

9. **Follow up on action items**  
   - Review the progress of previous action items at the start of each retro.  
   - Hold the team accountable for following through on commitments.  

10. **Keep it positive and forward-focused**  
   - Focus on constructive feedback and solutions rather than blame or negativity.  
   - Frame challenges as opportunities for improvement in the next sprint.  


## 6. Backlog refinement: how to prepare effectively

🎯 Activity: Backlog makeover
If our backlog could go to the spa, what would it look like afterward?
Let’s discuss what a fully pampered, perfectly refined backlog should have (e.g., clear acceptance, a fresh coat of priority, etc.)
Each person adds one ‘makeover’ tip to the list (e.g., “less fluff, more stuff,” or “no more 'TBD'—it’s 2025!”).
🔹 Group synthesis:
Vote on one experiment you’ll add to your next refinement session.

**Backlog Refinement Best Practices**  

**Goal**: Ensure the backlog is well-prepared for upcoming sprints with clear, actionable user stories.  

1. **Prepare in advance**  
   - Review user stories and requirements ahead of time.  
   - Ensure stories are well-defined and include acceptance criteria.  

2. **Collaborate on story details**  
   - Work with the product owner to ensure all user stories have clear definitions and align with sprint goals.  
   - Ask clarifying questions to ensure complete understanding.  

3. **Estimate user stories together**  
   - Use consistent estimation techniques (e.g., dev days).  
   - Involve the entire team in estimating to get a broader perspective.  

4. **Prioritize based on value**  
   - Work with the product owner to prioritize user stories based on business value.  
   - Focus on what delivers the most value first.  

5. **Break down large stories**  
   - Split complex stories (epics) into smaller, manageable tasks.  
   - Ensure stories are small enough to be completed within a sprint.  

6. **Refine acceptance criteria**  
   - Ensure all stories have clear and specific acceptance criteria to guide development.  
   - Test the stories against the criteria during refinement.  

7. **Avoid overloading the backlog**  
   - Keep the backlog focused on the next few sprints, avoiding too many items far in advance.  
   - Reevaluate older items to see if they are still relevant.  

8. **Review dependencies and blockers**  
   - Identify any dependencies or potential blockers for each story.  
   - Discuss and plan for how to address them in advance.  

9. **Ensure user stories are actionable**  
   - Make sure each story is clear enough for developers to begin work without further clarification.  
   - Remove any ambiguity to avoid delays during the sprint.  

10. **Time-box the session**  
   - Keep the session focused and within a set time limit to avoid long, inefficient discussions.  
   - Regularly time-box refinement to ensure you’re not spending too much time on backlog grooming.  

**Outcome**: A well-refined backlog with clear, prioritized, and actionable user stories ready for the next sprint.

## **7. Wrap-Up & Key Takeaways (5 min)**  
🎯 *Goal:* Ensure action beyond the session.  

🔹 **Final Round:** *“What’s one insight or best practice you’ll take from today’s discussion?”*  
- Everyone shares **one actionable takeaway**.  
- Wrap up by summarizing **top learnings** and next steps.  

---

## **Why This Works:**  
✅ **Experience-Driven:** PMs learn from real stories instead of theoretical best practices.  
✅ **Highly Interactive:** Keeps engagement high through discussions and activities.  
✅ **Action-Oriented:** Ensures takeaways can be implemented immediately.
