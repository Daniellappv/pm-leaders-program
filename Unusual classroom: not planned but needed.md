### Classroom Plan: **"Understanding Processes & Accountability"**  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Goal:** Explore why the Project DB update task was not completed as instructed, assess the PMs' task management processes, and provide practical guidance to improve accountability and execution.

---

### **1. Setting the Scene (10 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Create a safe and open environment for discussion.  
- **Introduction:**  
  - Today’s session isn’t about pointing fingers but about understanding what happened and improving how we work together. My goal is to help you develop effective systems to process tasks and ensure we follow through on commitments.  
- **Trigger Context:**  
  - Briefly explain the situation: the deadline was missed despite verbal confirmations, leading to gaps in the Project DB.  
  - Emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and clarity in task management.

### **2. Open Discussion: What Happened? (15 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Understand the PMs’ perspective and identify the root causes.  
- **Questions to Explore:**  
  1. *When you were tasked with updating the Project DB, how did you approach it?*  
  2. *Did you understand what was expected of you?*  
  3. *Were there challenges or roadblocks that made it difficult to complete the task?*  
  4. *What made you confirm the task was done when it wasn’t? (e.g., misunderstanding, time pressure, oversight)*  
  5. *How do you prioritize and track tasks in general?*  
- **Encourage Honesty:**  
  - Reassure them that this is a learning exercise: "Mistakes happen; what matters is how we learn from them."

### **3. Identifying Gaps & Bottlenecks (15 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Analyze their current process for task management.  
- **Common Pain Points to Explore:**  
  - Lack of clarity in task instructions.  
  - Overcommitting or poor time management.  
  - Not using tools effectively to track and manage work.  
  - Hesitation to communicate delays or issues.  
- **Facilitator's Role:**  
  - Map their responses to possible gaps. For example:  
    - If tasks aren’t written down: Suggest better task documentation.  
    - If priorities are unclear: Emphasize the importance of confirming expectations.  
    - If tools aren’t used well: Highlight ways to optimize their use.

### **4. Sharing Best Practices (15 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Offer practical advice to improve task management and accountability.  
- **Advice & Tools:**  
  1. **Clear Expectations:** Always confirm the task, deadline, and deliverables in writing (email, task manager).  
  2. **Break Tasks into Steps:** Avoid overwhelming tasks; split them into actionable items.  
  3. **Time Management:** Use techniques like time blocking or prioritization frameworks (e.g., Eisenhower Matrix).  
  4. **Track Progress:** Use a shared tool (e.g., Trello, Asana) to track tasks and updates.  
  5. **Transparency:** If you face roadblocks or delays, communicate early and honestly.  
  6. **Self-Check:** Before confirming a task is done, ensure you’ve reviewed and verified it.

### **5. Actionable Takeaways (5 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Summarize the session and outline the next steps.  
- Based on today’s discussion, here’s what I’d like us to implement immediately:  
  1. Use a shared tool to track tasks and deadlines for better visibility.  
  2. Always confirm task completion with evidence (e.g., a screenshot, updated field).  
  3. Make it a habit to flag challenges early, so we can solve them as a team.  
- Assign them a quick task:  
  - Update the Project DB with a specific field by the end of the day. Tomorrow, we’ll check in to see how it went.

### **6. Q&A and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Address concerns and close on a constructive note.  
- What questions or thoughts do you have about what we discussed today?  
Remember, this is about growth, not criticism. Let’s work together to get better at what we do.
