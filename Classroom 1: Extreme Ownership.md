---

#### Introduction (5 minutes)

- **Welcome & Introduction**  
  - As new project managers, it’s essential to understand the cultural values that drive our company.
  - Today, we’re focusing on *Extreme Ownership*, which we define as *100% responsibility* and being the cause in the matter.

#### What is 100% Responsibility? (10 minutes)

_"Responsibility means being able to respond to the best of your ability to whatever situation you may face in your life."_ Sadhguru 

_Without Taking Responsibility For Your Incapabilities, There Is No Possibility Of Becoming Capable._ 

- **Definition**  
  - 100% responsibility means recognizing that you are the cause of everything in your life and work, taking full ownership of your actions and their outcomes, and feeling empowered to act in any situation. It’s about actively engaging with challenges and collaborating with your team to drive results. It’s about acknowledging that you are the primary factor in your success or failure. It is the possibility to ACT.
- **Key Principles**  
  - There are no excuses for obstacles.
  - If someone is blocking you, it’s your job to address it actively.
  - You must be relentless in finding solutions.

#### What 100% Responsibility is Not (10 minutes)

It’s not about taking on others' responsibilities or doing everything yourself. Instead, it’s about leading with accountability, collaborating with your team, and driving results despite challenges.

- **Clarifying Misconceptions**  
  - **Not Blame or Guilt:** Responsibility should not be confused with blame or guilt. When you approach responsibility with guilt or blame, you’re not addressing the problem; instead, you’re contributing to it. 
  - **Not Sacrifice:** True responsibility does not mean sacrificing one’s well-being for others. Instead, being responsible should come from a place of strength and self-awareness, allowing individuals to contribute effectively without losing themselves. Engaging in actions solely out of sacrifice is not sustainable; over time, it will turn into a heavy burden.
  - **Not a Burden:** Responsibility is not about feeling overwhelmed or burdened by the weight of expectations. Responsibility should be a source of empowerment, not exhaustion.
  - **Not Control Over Others:** Taking responsibility does not mean trying to control or manipulate others’ actions or decisions. You are only able to take responsibility for your own life, not for the lives of others. True responsibility involves focusing on one’s own actions and choices rather than trying to manage others.
  - **Not Just a Duty:** Responsibility is not merely fulfilling obligations or duties. It should come from a deeper understanding and connection to oneself and the situation. When responsibility is reduced to just a duty, it loses its true meaning. It should reflect your identity rather than simply being a task to complete.

#### Why 100% Responsibility matters (10 minutes)

1. **Empowerment**: When team members take responsibility, they feel more in control and can really make a difference in their roles. It encourages them to develop problem-solving skills, resilience, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

3. **Teamwork**: Owning up to our actions builds trust and open communication. This makes it easier for everyone to work together and support each other. It leads to higher productivity, better communication, and a more cohesive team environment.

3. **Culture**: Responsibility helps Datopian succeed by creating a culture of accountability and trust - where we aim high and avoid blaming each other. Ultimately, when we all take ownership, our projects succeed, leading to better client satisfaction and company growth.


#### Real-Life Examples (10 minutes)

- **Case Study 1: Project Challenge**. Let’s say a project is behind schedule because a client is delayed. An example of Extreme Ownership would be reaching out to the client regularly, escalating the issue if necessary, and proposing alternative solutions instead of just waiting for them to respond.
- **Case Study 2: Team Communication**. If there’s a misunderstanding within the team about project requirements, instead of blaming others for not being clear, you would initiate a team meeting to clarify expectations and ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Case Study 3: Resource Management**. Imagine you’re leading a project and realize that your team is short on resources, which could impact the timeline. The resourcing team doesn't reply to your email for eg. 2 days. Instead of complaining about the lack of support, you take the initiative to assess the situation, follow up and if needed message people directly to communicate the need for additional resources to management, and come up with a temporary plan to redistribute tasks among team members to keep things moving.
- **Case Study 4: Client Feedback**. Let’s say a client provides negative feedback about a deliverable. Instead of getting defensive or placing blame on the team for not meeting expectations, you take ownership by actively listening to the client’s concerns, discussing them with the team, and developing a clear plan to address the feedback and improve future work.
- **Case Study 5: Scope Creep**. Imagine you're managing a project, and the client keeps adding new features that weren't part of the original agreement. Instead of allowing the project to spiral out of control or blaming the client for not sticking to the plan, you take ownership by organizing a meeting with the client to discuss the impact of these changes on the timeline and budget. You present a clear scope of work and negotiate what can be realistically achieved within the original framework.
- **Case Study 6: Team Morale**. Suppose you notice that your team is feeling overwhelmed and demotivated due to tight deadlines and increasing pressure. Rather than ignoring the issue or assuming it's not your responsibility, you step in to facilitate a team discussion. You encourage everyone to share their concerns and brainstorm ways to redistribute the workload or adjust timelines, fostering a supportive environment that prioritizes team well-being while keeping the project on track.

#### Assignment (10 minutes)

- **Group Activity**  
  For our assignment today, I want each of you to reflect on a recent project or task where you felt challenged. Think about how you could have exercised Extreme Ownership/100% Responsibility in that situation. Write down your thoughts on the following questions:

  1. What was the challenge?
  2. How did you react?
  3. What could you have done differently to take ownership?
  4. How can you apply this mindset moving forward?

- **Share with the Group**  
  We’ll take a few minutes for each of you to share your reflections. This will help us learn from each other's experiences.

#### Q&A Session (15 minutes)

- **Open Floor for Questions**  
  Now, I’d like to open the floor for any questions or thoughts about Extreme Ownership/100% Responsibility. What challenges do you foresee in applying this principle, or do you have any clarifications you need?

#### Conclusion (5 minutes)

- **Wrap-Up**  
  Remember, embracing Extreme Ownership is a continuous journey. It is a muscle that we will be building over time.
  I’m here to support you as you implement this value in your work.
  Let’s commit to being proactive and accountable in our roles as project managers.
