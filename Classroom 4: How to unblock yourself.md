### STEPS FOR GETTING UNBLOCKED 

1. Spot the blocker
2. Google it first
3. ChatGPT for the win
4. Don’t underestimate internal resources
5. Don't forget to recommend

### **Step 1: Think and write down the problem (10 minutes)**  

Keeping the problem in your head often makes it feel bigger than it is. Writing it down forces you to articulate and structure it.

When faced with a blocker, the first step is to write it down. Keeping it in your head can make it feel bigger than it is.

#### Steps:

- Situation: What is the context or background?
- Challenge: What exactly is stopping progress?
- Options: What are some possible ways forward?

**Example:**  

Delayed approval for the design of a critical feature  

#### **Situation**  
The team completed the design for a critical feature as planned. The design requires client approval before development can begin. The approval process was outlined in the project timeline and communicated to the client two weeks ago. The team is now ready to start development as scheduled, but the client has not yet provided feedback or approval.

#### **Problem**  
Without the client’s approval, development cannot proceed, risking delays in the sprint and the overall project timeline. The team cannot afford to reallocate resources to other tasks without impacting other planned work.

#### **Options to resolve**  
1. **Send a follow-up email with a hard deadline**  
   - Clearly communicate the urgency and provide a deadline for the client to approve or request changes, e.g., "We need your feedback by the end of today/tomorrow to maintain the project timeline."

2. **Schedule a review meeting with the client**  
   - Set up a short call or meeting to walk the client through the design and get immediate feedback and approval.

3. **Escalate the issue**  
   - Notify the project sponsor or relevant stakeholders on the client side to emphasize the urgency and ensure the approval process is expedited.

4. **Propose proceeding with assumptions**  
   - Inform the client that the team will proceed with the current design unless critical feedback is received by a specific deadline. Highlight that changes after development starts may result in additional costs or delays.

5. **Reassign resources temporarily**  
   - Allocate the team to other tasks in the sprint to avoid idle time, clearly communicating the impact on delivery timelines if the design approval is further delayed.

Each option offers a distinct approach to resolving the blocker, ensuring the team remains proactive in addressing the situation.

**Activity: OPTIONAL** 
1. Ask participants to think of a blocker they faced recently.  
2. Write down the situation, challenge, and at least two options.  
3. Share examples with the group for feedback.


### **Step 2: Google it first**  

Google should always be your first port of call. It’s like having the world’s largest library at your fingertips.

**WHY it is better:**
- Fosters independence and initiative: Every time you solve a problem on your own, you build confidence and develop a deeper understanding of the issue. When you rely on Google, you're actively learning instead of passively receiving answers. This independence is particularly valuable in distributed teams, where colleagues may not always be available.
- Saves time for everyone: When you ask a teammate, they need to stop their work, think about your issue, and explain it—often interrupting their focus. With Google, you can get instant answers without disrupting others. This is especially critical when teammates are spread across time zones or juggling multiple priorities.
- Ensures timeliness: Teammates might not respond immediately, leaving you stuck. Google is always available, ensuring that your workflow continues uninterrupted.
- Prepares you for complex questions: When you do need to escalate an issue to a teammate, researching first ensures you’re informed. You can approach them with context, potential solutions, and specific questions, making the discussion more productive.

Let me give you a practical example. Say you need to figure out how to migrate issues into Github from another system. Instead of spending hours fumbling around in the interface or documentation, just type in a query like, ‘How to import issues into Github step-by-step’. Chances are, you’ll find an official guide, a forum post, or even a video tutorial that walks you through it in minutes.

The key is to frame your question well. Be specific, and include keywords that describe the exact problem you’re trying to solve.

Use Google not just for answers but to educate yourself about the problem. That way, you not only unblock yourself but also build your expertise.

### Step 3: ChatGPT for the win

Next, let’s talk about ChatGPT. It is as important for the same reasons we just discussed. 

Think of it as your brainstorming buddy or assistant who’s available 24/7. Where Google provides answers, ChatGPT can help you shape ideas or generate structured outputs.

For example, you’re tasked with drafting a client update email, and you’re not sure how to word it. You can ask ChatGPT:
‘Can you help me write a polite email to update a client about a delayed milestone and propose a revised timeline?’
Within seconds, you’ll get a clear, professional draft that you can tweak and send.

ChatGPT can also help with:

Brainstorming solutions: Ask it for potential strategies or approaches to your challenges.
Code assistance: If you’re stuck debugging, describe the issue, and it can suggest possible fixes.
Learning aid: Use it to summarize dense documentation or generate examples to understand concepts better.

The magic lies in how you interact with ChatGPT. Provide context, be specific about what you need, and iterate if necessary. This tool isn’t just about speed—it’s about depth and clarity. Combined with Google, you can address almost any obstacle with confidence and efficiency.

### **Step 4: Do not underestimate internal resources (5 minutes)**  

In a fully remote environment, internal resources are invaluable for overcoming challenges efficiently. We have an extensive Delivery RTO (Return to Operations) document that includes all our delivery-related processes, guiding us through project management, resource allocation, and prioritization. This document ensures that all team members are aligned on procedures and protocols, reducing confusion and improving project execution.

Additionally, we use Xero to maintain financial information for projects, including old invoices, expenses, and budget tracking. This system allows us to access a historical record of financial transactions quickly, enabling more informed decision-making and better financial management.

Our shared drive is another critical resource. It houses all relevant documents, files, and records pertaining to projects. Whether it’s meeting notes, past project reports, client contracts, or any other necessary files, this centralized location makes it easy for all team members to access the information they need, anytime. This reduces duplication of effort, minimizes knowledge gaps, and promotes a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute effectively.

Utilizing these internal resources not only streamlines our work but also fosters a culture of efficiency and proactive problem-solving within our team. Don’t underestimate the power of these tools—they are integral to our success in a remote setting.

Before reinventing the wheel, check if someone in your team has already solved a similar problem. Search old templates, documentation, or financial reports.

**Question:**  
- Do you actually have clarity on what is where on the Drive? You can explore the shared folders or tools for documentation related to a task they’ve worked on.

### **Step 5: Always have a recommendation (15 minutes)**  

If you’ve gone through all these steps and still find yourself stuck, it’s time to reach out to a teammate. However, don’t just present the problem to them without any thought—always come prepared. **The key here is to have a recommendation in mind, based on the options you’ve already considered.**

Think about what you’ve tried so far, what the sticking points are, and what potential solutions you’ve identified. Present your teammate with your thoughts and ask for their feedback. This not only helps you get the help you need but also demonstrates initiative and problem-solving skills. It shows that you’ve put in the effort to resolve the issue before seeking assistance, which is crucial in a remote team environment where self-reliance is key. Imagine you’re the colleague being approached. Would you rather hear, ‘I don’t know what to do,’ or ‘Here’s what I’ve found so far, and this is what I’d recommend’?”  

Remember, getting help isn’t about passing the problem off entirely; it’s about leveraging your team’s collective expertise to unblock yourself efficiently. Adopt the option-recommendation approach:  
  1. Summarize the problem.  
  2. Present 2–3 options you’ve identified.  
  3. Share your preferred option with a reason.  

**Example:**  
- Scenario: You’re unsure how to structure a client meeting agenda.  
- Approach a colleague:  
  - “Here’s the challenge: I need an agenda for a client meeting to discuss project updates. These are the topics I’ve identified. I think structuring it as 50% updates, 30% feedback, and 20% action planning works best. What do you think?”

#### **Step 5: Practice unblocking a real blocker (15 minutes)**  
**Group activity:**  
1. Discuss a real blocker with the group (to be provided by participants):  
   - Someone to provide us with a question / blocker and we try to solve it together
   - Plan B: Just picked up a project and have no idea what to do re invoicing. What do I do?
2. Present the results

---

#### **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**  
**Key reminders:**  
1. Write down your blocker to clarify your thoughts.  
2. Always search online first (Google, ChatGPT).  
3. Use internal resources like shared drives.  
4. Approach colleagues with recommendations, not just problems.  

**Closing statement:**  
“Unblocking yourself isn’t just about solving the problem; it’s about building a mindset of resourcefulness and independence. With these tools and techniques, you can tackle any challenge—and inspire your team to do the same.”
