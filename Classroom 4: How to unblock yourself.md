**Why it matters**  
- Faster resolution of issues reduces project delays.
- Builds confidence in navigating uncertainties independently.
- Enhances team collaboration by focusing on solutions, not problems.

**Learning outcomes**  
- Understand how to define and break down problems effectively.
- Learn to leverage readily available tools like Google and ChatGPT for solutions.
- Gain strategies to collaborate efficiently with peers by presenting clear recommendations.

**Engagement tips**  
HANDS-ON SESSION
- Would like to encourage participation in discussions and activities. Bring in real-life examples and blockers. 
- No blocker is “too small” to explore.
- Let's have an interactive and practical learning experience.

### **Step 1: Think and write down the problem (10 minutes)**  

Keeping the problem in your head often makes it feel bigger than it is. Writing it down forces you to articulate and structure it.

When faced with a blocker, the first step is to write it down. Keeping it in your head can make it feel bigger than it is.

#### Steps:

- Situation: What is the context or background?
- Challenge: What exactly is stopping progress?
- Options: What are some possible ways forward?

**Example:**  
- Write down a recent blocker from your current projects.
   - Example: “The client hasn’t provided data for an integration we need to start building.”
List the situation, challenge, and at least two possible options.

**Activity:**  
1. Ask participants to think of a blocker they faced recently.  
2. Write down the situation, challenge, and at least two options.  
3. Share examples with the group for feedback.


### **Step 2: Leverage tools – Google and ChatGPT (10 minutes)**  
**Discussion:**  
- Introduce Google as the first go-to tool for most challenges.  
  - Example: “Need to figure out how to import issues into Github? A quick Google search like ‘importing issues into Github step-by-step’ can save hours.”  
- Highlight ChatGPT as a powerful tool for guidance.  
  - Example: “Ask ChatGPT something like, ‘What’s the best way to prioritize a backlog in Scrum?’ and you’ll get clear steps or even alternative methods.”  Give me the agenda for a kick-off meeting I have with the client. For generating content, it is doing an amazing job.

### **Step 3: Search internal resources (5 minutes)**  
**Discussion:**  
- Remind participants that internal resources like Google Drive and Xero often hold historical data, documentation, or solutions.  
- Example: Before reinventing the wheel, check if someone in your team has already solved a similar problem. Search old templates, documentation, or financial reports. 

**Activity:**  
- Do you actually have clarity on what is where on the Drive? You can explore the shared folders or tools for documentation related to a task they’ve worked on.

### **Step 4: Always have recommendations (15 minutes)**  
**Discussion:**  
- Stress the importance of initiative when asking for help:  
  - “Imagine you’re the colleague being approached. Would you rather hear, ‘I don’t know what to do,’ or ‘Here’s what I’ve found so far, and this is what I’d recommend’?”  
- Adopt the option-recommendation approach:  
  1. Summarize the problem.  
  2. Present 2–3 options you’ve identified.  
  3. Share your preferred option with a reason.  

**Example:**  
- Scenario: You’re unsure how to structure a client meeting agenda.  
- Approach a colleague:  
  - “Here’s the challenge: I need an agenda for a client meeting to discuss project updates. These are the topics I’ve identified. I think structuring it as 50% updates, 30% feedback, and 20% action planning works best. What do you think?”

#### **Step 5: Practice unblocking a real blocker (15 minutes)**  
**Group activity:**  
1. Discuss a real blocker with the group (to be provided by participants):  
   - Someone to provide us with a question / blocker and we try to solve it together
   - Plan B: Just picked up a project and have no idea what to do re invoicing. What do I do?
2. Present the results

---

#### **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**  
**Key reminders:**  
1. Write down your blocker to clarify your thoughts.  
2. Always search online first (Google, ChatGPT).  
3. Use internal resources like shared drives.  
4. Approach colleagues with recommendations, not just problems.  

**Closing statement:**  
“Unblocking yourself isn’t just about solving the problem; it’s about building a mindset of resourcefulness and independence. With these tools and techniques, you can tackle any challenge—and inspire your team to do the same.”
