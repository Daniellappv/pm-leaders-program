## Remote work realities - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly

_Remote work is here to stay. Some love it, some struggle with it, but one thing is clear—it’s changing the way we work forever. Let’s break down the good, the bad, and the ugly of managing projects in a fully remote environment._

_But before I dive in, I want to hear from you—_

**🎯 Interactive Poll (1 min)** _"What do you think is the biggest challenge managing remote teams?_

- (Use Slido/Mentimeter OR ask people to type in the chat)
- After 30 seconds, read out some responses to validate their experiences:  
    _“I see some common themes—communication issues, accountability gaps, time zones—yep, I’ve been there too!_

## **1️⃣ The Good – Why Remote Work is a Game-Changer (3 min)**

As project managers, we’re constantly juggling tasks, teams, and deadlines. Remote work can actually make our jobs easier—if done right.

1. First, **flexibility**. You’re no longer tied to an office, which means you can structure your day in a way that suits both your productivity and your project needs.
2. You can also tap into a **global talent pool**, building teams with the best people for the job, rather than being restricted to local hires.
3. Then, there’s **cost efficiency**. Travel expenses drop, office overhead disappears, and time spent in pointless meetings is reduced. Your team gets more focused work done.
4. Remote work also pushes us to be **better communicators**. Without the luxury of hallway chats, we have to be more deliberate about setting expectations, providing updates, and keeping everyone aligned. This makes us sharper and more efficient leaders.
5. And let’s not forget **work-life balance**. No long commutes, more time for personal life, and the ability to manage stress better—something that ultimately makes us more effective in our roles.

### BONUS addition 

**The Good: The Strategic Reward (3 min)**

1. **Reward #1: Deep-Work Flow State & Quality Assurance. **For high-complexity tasks (e.g., core system development, complex integrations), uninterrupted deep work is essential for quality. Remote work is the best environment for achieving this Flow State, resulting in lower bug rates and better architectural design.
2. **Reward #2: Global Talent Arbitrage.** Your competitive advantage is no longer proximity; it's access to the absolute best, most specialized talent in the world, regardless of cost-of-living differences. This directly impacts the quality and speed of project delivery.
3. **Reward #3: High-Trust Model $\rightarrow$ Lower Retention Risk.** Empowering team members to own their time signals radical trust. This trust is a critical factor in talent retention, reducing the astronomical cost and risk associated with losing high-performing engineers mid-project.

## **2️⃣ The Bad – The Challenges of Remote Work (3 min)**

_But it’s not all sunshine and WiFi. Remote work also brings challenges—some of which you already mentioned in the poll._

It comes with real challenges that impact how we lead and deliver results.

1. **Communication gaps are a major issue.** Messages get misinterpreted, delays creep in, and without face-to-face interactions, small misunderstandings can snowball into bigger problems.
2. Then there’s a **lack of visibility**. In an office, you can sense when a team member is struggling. Remotely, unless they speak up, you might not realize there’s an issue until it’s too late.
3. **Keeping the team engaged and motivated** is another challenge. Without casual office interactions, people can feel isolated. Team morale and collaboration require extra effort.
4. **Time zone differences** can slow things down. Trying to schedule a meeting across multiple time zones? Good luck. This can lead to decision-making bottlenecks and project delays.
5. And let’s be honest—**not everyone thrives in a remote environment.** Some team members struggle with self-discipline, procrastination, or the lack of external structure. As project managers, we need to recognize this and provide the right support.

### BONUS addition

1. **Risk #1: Information Debt and Stalled Sprints.** Information Debt is the remote equivalent of Technical Debt. It's the cost of poor communication, where context is continually lost. A question asked in a chat channel often requires synchronous clarification, resulting in high context-switching cost and halting sprint progress. Example: "A simple decision about data validation rules was left ambiguous in a brief email. Three developers built three different validation methods, resulting in a week of rollback and rework. The project absorbed significant Information Debt."
2. **Risk #2: The Latency of Feedback Loop.** Every hour of time zone separation is a unit of feedback latency. This is most critical in code review (PR) cycles. If a PR takes 24 hours to review instead of 2 hours, your entire development velocity is halved.
3. **Risk #3: The Unforeseen Psychological Risk.** Isolation and lack of clear boundaries are direct precursors to team burnout. A burnt-out team member is a massive project risk, often leading to hasty code, shortcuts, and an accumulation of technical debt.

## **🎭 The Ugly – When Remote Work Fails (2 min)**

Now, let’s talk about what happens when remote work completely falls apart—because we’ve all seen it.

As a rule of thumb, trying to force in-office habits onto a global team is a recipe for failure. 

1. First, **lack of boundaries.** Some companies and clients expect 24/7 availability. Without clear work-life separation, burnout becomes inevitable—for you and your team.
2. Then, there’s **poor leadership**. If expectations aren’t clear, processes aren’t defined, or communication is chaotic, remote teams become disorganized fast. And on the flip side, micromanagement in a remote setting is a disaster. Checking in too often makes people feel distrusted and kills productivity.
3. Another nightmare? **Tech failures.** If key tools go down, security issues arise, or a team member’s internet is unreliable, progress can come to a halt. Unlike in an office, there’s no IT team at your desk to fix things immediately.
4. And finally, **trust issues.** If leadership doesn’t trust the team, they introduce excessive tracking software, unnecessary check-ins, or rigid rules that make remote work unbearable. Instead of fostering accountability, they create frustration and resentment.

As project managers, our role is to navigate these challenges, put the right structures in place, and ensure remote work helps—not hinders—our teams. So how do we make remote work actually work? 

But before we look at this, we want to ask ourselves the following question: 

### IS REMOTE WORK FOR YOU?**  

Remote work isn’t for everyone. While it offers flexibility and freedom, it also comes with challenges that not everyone is suited for. Before you jump into a remote role—especially in industries like project management, oil, and offshore operations—it’s important to assess whether you’re a good fit.  

So, how do you know if remote work is right for you?  

First, **self-management** is key. You won’t have someone constantly checking in on you, so you need to take ownership of your tasks, deadlines, and productivity.  

Second, you have to be **comfortable with a lack of clear instructions**. In remote settings, things can be ambiguous, and you won’t always get step-by-step guidance. If you need direct supervision or struggle with uncertainty, remote work might be frustrating.  

Then, there’s the **proactive mindset**—remote work rewards those who take initiative, ask questions, and find solutions rather than waiting for instructions.  

Another critical skill is **intrinsic motivation**. Without an office environment and colleagues physically around you, staying motivated can be tough. If you rely on external pressure to get things done, remote work can feel isolating.  

Of course, **strong communication skills** are a must. When you’re not in the same room, misunderstandings happen easily. You need to be clear, concise, and proactive in how you communicate—whether it’s through emails, meetings, or documentation.  

**Adaptability** is another big one. Remote work often means working across time zones, dealing with tech issues, or adjusting to new ways of collaborating. You need to be flexible and open to change.  

But beyond these, there are a few other things to consider.  

- **Tech Savviness** – Remote work relies on digital tools. If you’re not comfortable troubleshooting basic tech issues or learning new software, it can slow you down.  
- **Ability to Separate Work and Life** – Working from home can blur the lines between personal and professional life. You need strong boundaries to avoid burnout.  
- **Comfort with Asynchronous Work** – In global teams, you won’t always get immediate responses. If you struggle with waiting for feedback or working independently for long stretches, remote work might be frustrating.  

At the end of the day, remote work isn’t just about where you work—it’s about how you work. Some people thrive in it, while others struggle. If you recognize these traits in yourself, chances are, you’ll do well in a remote setting.

## **Core pillars of remote project management 

### Asynchronous Communication & Documentation Best Practices (8 min)

_One of the biggest mistakes remote teams make is trying to communicate as if they’re in an office—expecting instant replies, holding too many meetings, and relying on chat messages that disappear into the void. But remote work requires a shift: **Async first, meetings second.**"_

_So let’s talk about how to master **asynchronous communication** and documentation—using the tools we rely on daily.

### **10 Asynchronous Communication & Documentation Best Practices for Remote Project Management**  

#### **1. Default to documentation**  

🔥 **Key Rule:** _"If something isn’t documented, it doesn’t exist."_

Instead of repeatedly explaining the same things in meetings or chat, document processes, best practices, and project details in a central place. Encourage team members to check the documentation before asking questions to minimize interruptions. When new information arises, update the documentation so it stays relevant and useful.

#### **2. Write clearly & concisely**  

Remote teams rely on written communication, so clarity is crucial. Avoid long, vague messages that require multiple follow-ups. Instead, provide structured information:

* Context: Why is this important?
* Issue: What needs to be addressed?
* Action Required: What should the reader do?

Using numbered lists, bullet points, and bold highlights can improve readability and ensure key details aren’t missed. Make messages easy to scan by using:

* Headings for different sections
* Short paragraphs instead of walls of text
* Action items in bold so they stand out
* TL;DR summaries at the top of long messages

This improves comprehension and reduces back-and-forth questions.

#### **3. Use centralized knowledge repositories**  

_"Important decisions shouldn’t be scattered across Google Chat. If it’s **important**, it goes into a Google Doc, email summary, or GitHub issue."_

_"Every repeatable process should have a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**—a Google Doc or GitHub README—so people don’t ask the same questions repeatedly."_

Having project information spread across emails, Slack messages, and personal notes leads to inefficiencies and lost information. Use tools like Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, or GitHub Wikis to create a single source of truth for project documentation, decisions, and guidelines. Standardize where each type of information is stored so everyone knows where to find what they need.

#### **4. Set response time expectations**  

One of the biggest challenges in async work is misaligned expectations on response times. Clearly define what response time is reasonable based on urgency:

* Urgent requests – Response within 4 hours (use specific channels like email with “URGENT” in the subject).
* General project questions – Response within 24 hours on Slack, GitHub, or email.
* Non-critical discussions – Can be handled via shared documents or forums without an immediate response.

This prevents people from waiting on answers that aren’t coming immediately and reduces unnecessary pressure to be "always online."

#### **5. Use asynchronous updates instead of status meetings**  

Daily standups or project updates don’t always need to be synchronous. The boards should be up-to-date and it should be clear what is the status of each item.

#### **6. Make decisions transparent**  

When decisions are made in private meetings or DMs, it creates knowledge gaps and inefficiencies. Instead, document all major decisions, including the reasoning behind them, in a public place like a project wiki, Notion page, or issue tracker. This helps new team members onboard quickly and ensures continuity if someone leaves the team.

#### **7. Document → Discuss → Decide**  

Before making decisions, follow a structured approach to ensure clarity and alignment:

1. Document – Clearly outline the problem, relevant data, potential solutions, and any constraints in a shared document, issue tracker, or wiki.
2. Discuss – Invite team members to provide feedback asynchronously through comments.
3. Decide – Summarize key takeaways, finalize the decision, and document the reasoning behind it so there’s a clear record for future reference.

This approach ensures decisions aren’t rushed, team input is captured efficiently, and knowledge is preserved for later use—reducing unnecessary meetings while maintaining transparency.

#### **8. Leverage asynchronous video & screen recordings**  

Some things are hard to explain in writing, like a UI issue or a technical workflow. Instead of scheduling a meeting, use tools like Loom, Google Meet recordings, or OBS Studio to record a quick walkthrough. This allows team members to watch at their convenience, rewind for clarity, and refer back to it later if needed.

#### **9. Assign Clear Ownership & Next Steps**  

In remote teams, it’s easy for tasks to fall through the cracks when messages are vague. Every task or discussion should have:

* A clear owner responsible for the next step
* A deadline (if applicable)
* A defined outcome or deliverable

For example, instead of saying "We need to fix the data visualization issue," write:
"@John, can you investigate the data visualization issue and propose a fix by Friday? Let’s review in the GitHub issue before finalizing."

#### **10. Balance async with synchronous check-ins**  

While async is great, some things need real-time meetings. Some discussions are best handled in real time—such as complex problem-solving, brainstorming, or resolving blockers. Schedule weekly or bi-weekly check-ins for deep dives and high-value discussions, but keep meetings structured and efficient.

## **2️⃣ Results-Driven Remote Culture (Trust & Accountability) – 8 min**

### **🎤 Opening (1 min)**

🎤 One of the biggest challenges in remote teams isn’t just communication—it’s trust and accountability. When you’re not sitting next to your colleagues, how do you know work is getting done? How do you build a culture where people take ownership rather than wait for instructions?

🎤 The key? Focus on results, not hours worked. High-trust teams thrive on clear expectations, autonomy, and accountability—not micromanagement.

### Key Principles of a Results-Driven Culture

1. ✅ Set Clear Expectations – Every team member should know what success looks like. Define deliverables, deadlines, and ownership **explicitly**.
2. ✅ Measure Outcomes, Not Input – Track progress based on what gets done, not how long someone was online or active in Slack.
3. ✅ Trust First, Verify Through Results – Assume competence and let results speak for themselves rather than micromanaging.
4. ✅ Encourage Ownership & Decision-Making – Empower people to solve problems and make decisions without waiting for approval at every step.

🎤 Micromanaging remote teams is a recipe for frustration. Instead, we need to trust our people, set clear expectations, and let them prove their impact through results, not presence.

### Practical Best Practices for Building Accountability

1. Define What "Done" Means – Avoid ambiguity. Ensure each task has a clearly responsible owner and well-defined success criteria. Accountability starts with clarity on what needs to be delivered and by whom.
2. Make progress visible – Utilize tools like GitHub issues, Notion, or project boards to track work transparently. When everyone can see what’s moving forward (or not), accountability becomes a shared responsibility.
3. Connect Tasks to Bigger Goals – Accountability improves when people understand why their work matters. Clearly link individual tasks to broader project objectives to encourage ownership and proactive problem-solving.
4. Always come from a place of trust - Assume positive intent. If something is delayed or unclear, start by asking questions rather than assuming negligence. Trust fosters autonomy, and autonomy leads to accountability.
5. Peer Reviews & Feedback Loops – Implement structured peer reviews and feedback loops. Instead of just checking work for errors, use reviews as an opportunity to reinforce accountability by ensuring high-quality outputs and continuous learning.

🎤 Accountability isn’t about checking in all the time—it’s about making work visible, setting expectations, and fostering a culture where people take responsibility for their outcomes.

### The Trust Formula

🛠 Clear Expectations + Autonomy + Regular Feedback = High-Trust Remote Culture

🎤 If we want a remote culture that works, we have to trust our team, give them autonomy, and create mechanisms for accountability that don’t rely on constant oversight. The best remote teams make work visible, create clarity, and trust each other to deliver.

🎤 When we shift from tracking hours to tracking results, we build a culture where people feel ownership over their work—leading to better outcomes and a more engaged team.

### **🎯 Interactive Discussion (1 min)**

_"Quick question: Have you ever been in a situation where remote work either **built or broke** trust? What happened?"_ (_Let a few participants share and discuss best practices._)

---

_"Now, let’s move into the next key pillar: **How to design workflows that don’t fall apart when one person is offline.**"_

## **3️⃣ Processes Over Tools: Building a Self-Sustaining Workflow – 8 min**

One of the biggest mistakes remote teams make is relying too much on tools to solve process problems. Tools are important, but without strong processes, they won’t fix accountability gaps, miscommunication, or inefficiencies.

Instead of asking, 'What tool should we use?' ask, 'What process will ensure things run smoothly—even if the tool changes?' The goal is to build workflows that are self-sustaining, clear, and adaptable.

In an office environment, many processes are informal. You can walk over to someone’s desk, clarify something quickly, or get an update in passing. But in remote work, none of that happens naturally. If processes aren’t clear, work slows down, misalignment grows, and accountability weakens.

This is why remote teams must be deliberate about how work gets done. A well-designed process replaces the casual in-office interactions with structured, reliable workflows—so that progress doesn’t depend on luck or presence, but on clarity and accountability.

### **1️⃣ A Good Process Works Without Live Conversations (2 min)**

💡 **Key Question:** _“If I step away today, can someone else pick up my work without asking me?”_

✅ **If YES → You have a strong process.**  
❌ **If NO → Your process relies too much on real-time interactions.**

### Key Differences Between Office & Remote Workflows

✅ Office Environment

* Informal discussions drive decision-making
* Progress happens through in-person check-ins
* Easy to clarify misunderstandings in real time
* Leadership can oversee work physically

✅ Remote Environment

* Clear processes replace casual office interactions
* Work must be documented to remain visible
* Decisions must be transparent and structured
* Autonomy is required, so workflows must be self-sustaining

In a remote setup, you can’t rely on managers watching over the team or quick hallway chats. Instead, you need strong, repeatable processes that ensure work moves forward, even when people aren’t online at the same time.

### Practical Best Practices for Process-Driven Remote Workflows

1. Define ‘How Work Gets Done’ in Writing – Establish clear guidelines on how tasks are created, discussed, reviewed, and completed. Use structured formats for requests, approvals, and updates to eliminate confusion.
2. Document First Approach – _"Processes should live in documentation, not in people’s heads."_ Prioritize documentation and written updates over meetings. Instead of ‘Let’s jump on a call,’ encourage ‘Let’s document it first, then discuss if needed.’ This ensures work moves forward without unnecessary delays.
3. Establish Decision-Making Frameworks – In an office, decisions happen in quick conversations. Remotely, create a system for logging key decisions so they’re transparent and referenceable. Use Decision Logs in Notion, Confluence, or GitHub.
4. Make Progress Visible Without Micromanagement – Use project tracking tools (GitHub Issues, Notion, Trello, Linear) to provide status updates without relying on constant check-ins. The goal is transparency, not surveillance.
5. Automate Where Possible – Reduce manual follow-ups by automating reminders, recurring check-ins, and status updates. This keeps processes efficient and lets the team focus on actual work rather than admin overhead.
6. Foster a Culture of Ownership & Self-Sufficiency – Processes should enable autonomy, not create bottlenecks. Instead of waiting for approval at every step, encourage teams to take ownership and move work forward within clear guardrails.
7. Regularly Review & Adapt Processes – The best remote processes aren’t rigid—they evolve. Schedule retrospectives to evaluate what’s working and adjust based on team feedback.

When remote processes are strong, work happens seamlessly—even across time zones, even with minimal oversight. But if processes are weak, everything slows down, decisions get lost, and accountability disappears.

Remember: remote success isn’t about using the right tools—it’s about building the right processes. Tools change, but great workflows last.

### **🎯 Interactive Discussion (2 min)**

_"Think about a time when you were blocked on a project because a process wasn’t documented. What happened? How could documentation have helped?"_ (_Let 1-2 people share their experiences._)

## **4️⃣ Mastering Time Zones & Global Collaboration – 8 min**

### **🎤 Opening (1 min)**

In a traditional office, everyone works in the same place and time zone, so coordinating schedules is easy. But in a remote team with global collaborators, time zones become one of the biggest challenges. How do you manage teams spread across the world and still ensure smooth communication, collaboration, and productivity? 

_Working across multiple time zones can either be a nightmare… or a superpower. The difference is how you manage it._

### Practical Best Practices for Managing Time Zones in Remote Teams

1. Align on Core Overlap Hours – Identify a small window where your team’s time zones overlap (e.g., 1–2 hours). Use these hours for real-time meetings or important collaboration. Everyone should know when their input is needed in sync. Maintain a shared team calendar with overlapping working hours clearly marked to plan synchronous communication effectively.
2. Reduce dependency on real-time meetings – Rely on asynchronous communication as your primary mode of collaboration. If meetings are difficult to schedule, use platforms like GitHub issues, Slack threads, or project management tools (Notion, Jira) to facilitate communication without waiting for overlapping work hours.
3. Use Clear and Structured Documentation – Without the luxury of in-person communication, documentation becomes your lifeline. Make decisions, updates, and discussions visible to the entire team so that no one feels left out due to time zone gaps.
4. Set Expectations for Response Times – Be clear about how long it should take for team members to respond or take action, based on different time zones. This helps avoid misunderstandings and frustration when responses are delayed.
5. Rotate Meeting Times (If Necessary) – When you have mandatory real-time meetings, try rotating the time for fairness. This ensures no team member is always the one to take the inconvenient time slot. For example, one month a team in Europe may take an early morning call, while another month, the US team takes the early slot.
6. Use Time Zone Management Tools – Leverage tools like World Time Buddy or Time Zone Converter to check availability across time zones before scheduling meetings. This helps avoid unnecessary confusion about when team members are available.
7. Document Decisions & Action Items Post-Meeting – After any live meetings (even in overlapping hours), send out a clear meeting summary with action items, deadlines, and next steps for those who couldn’t attend. This keeps everyone on the same page without expecting constant real-time availability.
8. Embrace the Power of Recorded Meetings – If real-time meetings are necessary but inconvenient, consider recording them. Make sure everyone knows when they need to watch the recording and how they can contribute asynchronously after the fact.
9. Create a “Time Zone Culture” – Make time zone differences part of your team culture. Instead of seeing them as barriers, treat them as part of your team’s diversity. This will encourage empathy and smoother interactions as people become more aware of time zone challenges.

### How Time Zones Can Be Your Advantage

Although it may seem challenging at first, working across time zones offers an unexpected advantage: 24-hour productivity. When one team finishes their day, another can pick up where they left off. With the right structure in place, your team can keep working, iterating, and improving around the clock.

### **🎯 Interactive Discussion (2 min)**

_"Have you ever had a frustrating time zone issue at work? What happened?"_ (_Encourage a short discussion on good and bad practices._)

 Now, let’s talk about the final piece: **Keeping remote teams engaged & avoiding burnout.**"_


## **5️⃣ Keeping Remote Teams Engaged & Avoiding Burnout – 8 min**

### **🎤 Opening (1 min)**

Remote work is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers flexibility and autonomy. On the other hand, it can lead to feelings of isolation, disengagement, and eventually burnout if not managed properly. As project managers, it’s crucial that we not only focus on productivity but also on maintaining a healthy and engaged team."

So, how can we ensure that our remote teams stay motivated, engaged, and, most importantly, avoid burnout? The key is to create a balanced work environment that promotes both personal well-being and team performance. 

_One of the biggest risks in remote work isn’t just disengagement—it’s burnout. Without a commute or clear ‘work hours,’ the lines between work and personal life blur._

### Practical Best Practices for Keeping Remote Teams Engaged & Avoiding Burnout

**1. Foster a Strong Team Culture (Virtually)**
Make remote team-building a priority. This could include virtual coffee breaks, happy hours, or game sessions to replicate the social elements of an office environment. Regularly checking in on personal well-being builds a strong culture even in a virtual setting.

**2. Set Clear Expectations and Boundaries**
Encourage team members to set boundaries around work hours. This is especially important when team members are working from home, as the temptation to work longer hours can lead to burnout. Let your team know it’s okay to step away from work and recharge.

**3. Regular 1:1 Check-ins & Feedback**
Regular, personalized check-ins allow you to gauge individual team members’ morale and engagement levels. In addition to work progress, ask about personal well-being and job satisfaction. Create a safe space for them to discuss any concerns they may have.

**4. Encourage Micro-Breaks, Deep work & Time Off**
Promote the importance of breaks during the workday. Encourage deep work and focus time. Encourage your team to take micro-breaks, step outside, or simply disconnect for a few minutes to refresh their minds. Regular time off or mental health days should be normalized to avoid burnout.

**5. Celebrate Achievements, Big & Small**
Recognizing achievements, whether personal or professional, helps maintain morale and reinforces a sense of accomplishment. Create a virtual “shout-out” or “celebration” channel in your communication tools (Slack, Teams) where the team can highlight milestones, birthdays, or other special occasions.

**6. Provide Opportunities for Growth**
Remote teams can feel stagnant if their professional development isn’t prioritized. Provide opportunities for training, upskilling, or mentorship to keep your team engaged in their growth journey. When people see that they can continue to develop, it adds purpose to their work.

**7. Create watercooler moments**
Initiate casual chats, fun check-ins, sharing. Schedule regular virtual team-building activities, such as online games, coffee chats, or sharing personal updates. All hands, General tactical, Occasionally digital hackathons and conferences if we need to ship something big 
    - Small talk at the beg of each meeting
    - Celebrate milestones, birthdays, or achievements via remote-friendly formats to build trust and camaraderie. People's birthdays are added to all team calendar
    - Watercooler chat channel, Our trips chat channel, Announcements, News, Links, etc
    👀 **Example:** Instead of _“Did you finish X?”_, ask _“How’s your week going?”_

**8. Rotate Responsibilities and Encourage Flexibility**
Keep things fresh by rotating responsibilities within the team when possible. It gives team members variety and keeps their roles interesting. Also, encourage flexibility in how team members approach their tasks—allowing them to find the work style that suits them best.

**9. Promote Transparent Communication About Workloads**
Be proactive in addressing workload management. Encourage team members to communicate if they’re overwhelmed, and prioritize tasks as a group. This transparency reduces stress and helps distribute the workload more evenly.

**10. Lead by Example**
As a project manager, your actions set the tone. Model work-life balance by setting your own boundaries and promoting a healthy work environment. If you’re constantly “on” and overworking, your team will likely follow suit. Show that you value balance and well-being.
